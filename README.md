# Flip the Coin ðŸª™

A decentralized coin flip game built as a Farcaster Mini App where players can join global rounds, pick heads or tails, and win ETH.

## Features

- **Global Rounds**: Join timed rounds with other players worldwide
- **Simple Gameplay**: Choose heads or tails with a 0.001 ETH buy-in per round
- **Winner Takes All**: Winners split the prize pool
- **Real-time Updates**: Live countdown timers and player statistics
- **Social Integration**: Built for Farcaster with sharing capabilities
- **Mobile-First**: Responsive design optimized for mobile devices with touch interactions
- **Blockchain Integration**: Smart contract deployment with Foundry framework

## How It Works

1. **Connect**: Sign in with your Farcaster account
2. **Choose**: Pick heads or tails before the timer runs out
3. **Wait**: Watch the coin flip animation
4. **Win**: If you chose correctly, you split the pot with other winners

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui
- **Blockchain**: Solidity smart contracts with Foundry framework
- **Network**: Base network integration
- **Authentication**: Farcaster authentication via Frame SDK
- **Wallet**: Coinbase OnchainKit integration
- **State Management**: React hooks with Tanstack Query
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (recommended)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd coin-flip
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Add your Farcaster app credentials and other config
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.

### Available Scripts

**Frontend:**
- `pnpm dev` - Start development server
- `pnpm build` - Build for production
- `pnpm start` - Start production server
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint

**Smart Contracts (Foundry):**
- `forge build` - Compile contracts
- `forge test` - Run contract tests
- `forge deploy` - Deploy contracts

## Game Mechanics

- **Round Duration**: 60 seconds per round
- **Buy-in**: 0.001 ETH per player
- **Teams**: Players choose between heads (team 1) or tails (team 2)
- **Payout**: Winners split the entire pot equally
- **Resolution**: Rounds resolve automatically using block-based randomness
- **Auto-Resolution**: Rounds resolve automatically when timer expires

## Smart Contract

The game includes a Solidity smart contract (`contracts/src/Coinflip.sol`) deployed with Foundry framework. For development and testing, a mock implementation (`lib/coin-flip-contract.ts`) is used to simulate contract behavior without requiring blockchain transactions.
